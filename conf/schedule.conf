# Most monitors are not designed to be run 24x7, doing so will drastically shorten it's lifespan.
# If you monitor supports sleeping when there's no video input, you can configure times for the
# system to switch on and off.
# If either field in each on/off pair is left blank, the system will remain off.

# Please enter times in 24 hour notation with no additional characters
