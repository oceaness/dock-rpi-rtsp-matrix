#### Manual layout override ####

# You can override the automatically generated default.layout.conf file by creating a
# layout.conf file in the conf directory or by renaming this file as such and continuing
# below.


### Resolution & Matrix ###

# Figure out the resolution of your target monitor (i.e. HD monitors are 1920x1080).
# If you have the monitor connected to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, you can run
# 'fbset -s' to find out the mode of the monitor.
# Take the total number of camera feeds you want to display on that monitor and imagine
# them positioned in a matrix (that may extend off-screen if you have more cameras than
# are conveniently displayed in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid). The size of those grid windows will
# be the monitor's mode dimensions divided by the number of cells in the x and y directions.

# For instance, you have six camera feeds and a 1080p monitor. That's more feeds than will
# fit nicely on a 2x2 grid but less than the nine required to make a 3x3 grid worthwhile.
# You can display the six feeds on four windows (960x540) with two of them off-screen.
# The feeds will be rotated through the window positions, showing all of them within a few
# seconds.

#
#     1920/2=960
#   _______________ 
#  |  _____ _____  |  _____
#  | |  1  |  2  | | | 5/6 |
#  | |_____|_____| | |_____|
#  | |  3  |  4  | |          1080/2=540
#  | |_____|_____| |
#  |_______________|
#       __|_|__
#        

# The window size (in this case 960x540) will determine the maximum resolution of your camera feeds.
# Selecting a feed that is less than or equal to the window resolution is safe, as the Pi
# can upscale if needed. Downscaling on the other hand is a lot more demanding of the limited
# resources available. The Pi may successfully downscale by a small amount but this will
# increase the load on the Pi.

# Newer more powerful Pi's will naturally cope with greater downscaling demands, so please do
# experiment by supplying feeds of higher resolution than the windows whilst keeping an eye on your
# hardwares resources, htop is a great utility for that and can installed via 'apt install htop'.


### Feeds ###

# List your feed urls in the feeds.conf file, one per line.


### Windows and Camera Names ###

# Camera names are used to identify the individual omxplayer instances playing each of them.
# The camera feeds should be setup in the same order as the names.

# Window names are not used for very much and are mostly to help make sense of the layout files.

# Window coordinates are crucial, and their order defines where the camera feeds are initially
# displayed on startup (i.e. the first camera name/feed in the first window).
# Rotation is disabled by default, so if you need to rotate, remember to add the rotate=true line.
# By default camera feeds progress through the windows from right-to-left, bottom-to-top.
# This behavior can be reversed by setting rotaterev=true in pi_video_matrix.conf.

# Configure at least as many windows as there are cameras. Unused off-screen windows are ignored
# as long as they are at the end of the list.

# Window positions are comprised of 2 pairs of co-ordinates.
# "x1 y1 x2 y2"
# x1 y1 designates the top left corner whilst
# x2 y2 designates the bottom right corner of each window.

# !!!! Warnings !!!!
# Please ensure that on-screen windows do not overlap, this will result in flickering as the Pi
# doesn't know which feed should be playing on those pixels.

# Do not configure window spaces with negative x or y positions.
# Off screen to the left or above the primary monitor window coordinates like
# "-960 0 -1 539" are broken.
# omxplayer is documented as supporting them, but it creates broken playback in testing.
